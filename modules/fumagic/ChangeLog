	* New module 'fumagic'. file(1) magic(5) based file type
	  recognition, in pure Tcl. Basic packages: runtime core,
	  mime-type engine, and a command wrapping the functionality for
	  easy access. The mime-type engine is not exactly so, it is
	  possible for to produce non-mime strings. We keep it for now
	  until the compiler has been put into this module as well.

	* rtcore.tcl:     Runtime core.
	* magic-mime.tcl: Mime engine
	* magic.tcl:      Wrapper.

	* Compiler packages now present as well
	
	* cgen.tcl:   Backend, tree-based code generator
	* cfront.tcl: Frontend, parsing of magic(5) files.
