This package provides commands to read NMEA standard data from COM ports or files.
The sentences are optionally checksummed and then passed on to user defined procs
for handling. To use a handler, create a proc with the NMEA sentence name in the
::nmea namespace. For example to process GPS fix data use "proc ::nmea::GPGSA". The
proc must take one argument, which is a list of the data values.

[section COMMANDS]
[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::nmea::open_port] [arg port] [opt speed]]
Open the specified COM port and read NMEA sentences when available. Port speed is set to
4800bps by default or to [arg speed].

[call [cmd ::nmea::open_file] [arg file] [arg rate]]
Open file [arg file] and read NMEA sentences, one per line, at the rate by [arg rate] in milliseconds.
The file format may omit the leading [const \$] and/or the checksum. If rate is <= 0 then lines
will only be processed when a call to [cmd do_line] is made. The rate may be adjusted by setting
::nmea::nmea(rate).

[call [cmd ::nmea::configure_port] [arg settings]]
Changes the current port settings. [arg settings] has the same format as fconfigure -mode.

[call [cmd ::nmea::close_port]]
Close the open port

[call [cmd ::nmea::close_file]]
Close the open file

[call [cmd ::nmea::do_line]]
If there is a currently open file, this command will read and process a single line from it.

[call [cmd ::nmea::log] [arg file]]
Starts or stops file logging. If a file name is specified then all NMEA output will be logged
to the file in append mode. If file is an empty string then any logging will be stopped.

[call [cmd ::nmea::checksum] [arg data]]
Returns the checksum of the supplied data

[call [cmd ::nmea::write] [arg sentence] [arg data]]
If there is a currently open port, this command will write the specified sentence and data in
proper NMEA checksummed format.

[list_end]

[section VARIABLES]
[list_begin definitions]

[def ::nmea::checksum]
A boolean value which determines whether incoming sentences are validated or not.

[def ::nmea::rate]
When reading from a file this sets the rate that lines are processed in milliseconds.
