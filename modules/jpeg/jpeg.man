This package provides commands to query and modify JPEG images. JPEG
stands for [term {Joint Photography Experts Group}] and is a standard
for the lossy compression of photographical images. It is specified at
[uri LINK_HERE].

[section COMMANDS]
[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::jpeg::imageInfo] [arg file]]

Returns a dictionary with keys [const version], [const units],
[const xdensity], [const ydensity], [const xthumb], and
[const ythumb]. The values are the associated properties of the JPEG
image in [arg file].

Throws an error if [arg file] is not a JPEG image.


[call [cmd ::jpeg::dimensions] [arg file]]

Returns the dimensions of the JPEG [arg file] as a list of the
horizontal and vertical pixel count.

Throws an error if [arg file] is not a JPEG image.


[call [cmd ::jpeg::thumbnail] [arg file]]

This procedure will return the binary thumbnail image data, if a JPEG
thumbnail is included in [arg file], and the empty string
otherwise. Note that it is possible to include thumbnails in formats
other than JPEG although that is not common. The command finds
thumbnails that are encoded in either the JFXX or EXIF segments of the
JPEG information.

Throws an error if [arg file] is not a JPEG image.


[call [cmd ::jpeg::exit] [arg file]]

Returns all EXIF data stored in the JPEG [arg file]. The format is a 2
level dictionary.

The two top level keys are [const main] and [const thumbnail]. The sub
dictionaries contain the EXIF information about the main image and
thumbnail. For example:

[nl]
[example {
    set exif {
	main {
	    Make     Canon
	    Model    {Canon DIGITAL IXUS}
	    DateTime {2001:06:09 15:17:32}
	}
	thumbnail {
	    DateTime {2000:09:30 10:59:45}
	}
    }
}]

Throws an error if [arg file] is not a JPEG image.


[call [cmd ::jpeg::getComments] [arg file]]

Returns a list containing all the JPEG comments found in the file.

Throws an error if [arg file] is not a valid JPEG image.


[call [cmd ::jpeg::addComment] [arg file] [arg text]]

Adds a plain [arg text] comment to the JPEG image in [arg file].


[call [cmd ::jpeg::addComment] [arg file] [arg keyword] [arg lang] [arg keyword2] [arg text]]

Adds a unicode (international) comment to the JPEG image in [arg file],
just before the first data chunk. Will throw an error if no data chunk
is found. [arg keyword] has to be less than 80 characters long to
conform to the JPEG specification. [arg keywords] is the translated
[arg keyword], in the language specified by the language identifier
[arg lang].
