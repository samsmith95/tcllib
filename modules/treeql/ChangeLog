2004-10-03 Colin McCormack <coldstore@users.sourceforge.net>

	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: bumped version to 1.2
	* treeql.tcl: moved K operator into object (avoiding namespace conflict)
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: removed getvals - redundant with get.  Renamed do_getvals to do_get.
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: made all attribute string accessors terminate query.
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: removed args arg to give error if more query operators are present after a string accessor.
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: removed rootname operator - redundant
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: made earlier generate proper descendants & changed test case for proper semantics
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: removed sapply and all references to it - it was improperly implemented and redundant with apply.
	* treeql.test: changed path to list.tcl and tree.tcl to use normalize, so you can run the test from the treeql directory
	* treeql.test: changed usage of [getvals] to [get]
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: made all mapping commands consistently handle errors.
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl: transform: removed some confusing local vars (using $query), changed arg order, fixed error.
	* treeql.tcl,treeql84.tcl,treeql.test: foreach changed argument order
