The [package yaml] package provides a simple Tcl-only library for parsing the
YAML [uri http://www.yaml.org/] data exchange format as specified in 
[uri http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.1/].

There is some ambiguity in parsing YAML because YAML has type information that
is not maintained by the Tcl conversion.  The [package yaml] package returns
data as a Tcl [cmd dict].  Either the [package dict] package or Tcl 8.5 is
required for use.

[section COMMANDS]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::yaml::yaml2dict] [opt [arg options]] [arg txt]]

Parse yaml formatted text [arg txt] into a Tcl dict and return the value.

[list_begin definitions]
[def [const -file]]

[arg txt] should be a filename of a YAML-stream.


[def "[const -types] [arg list]"]

The [arg list] is a type list for the yaml-scalar types.(e.g. !!str !!timestamp !!integer !!true ...)

[example { -types {timestamp integer null true false}}
]
In this case, if a string matched "timestamp", converted to the TCL internal timestamp.(e.g. "2001-12-15T02:59:43.1Z" => 1008385183)

[def "[const -m:true] [arg param]"]

The [arg param] is two elements of list for the value of true, and considered strings.

[example { -m:true {1 {true on + yes y}}}
]
In this case, the string "yes" found in YAML Stream, automatically converted 1.

[def "[const -m:false] [arg param]"]

The [arg param] is two elements of list for the value of false, and considered strings.

[example { -m:false {0 {false off - no n}}}
]

[def "[const -m:null] [arg param]"]

The [arg param] is two elements of list for the value of null, and considered strings.

[example { -m:null {"" {null nil "" ~}}}
]

[def [const -validate]]

Experiment: Output stream contains YAML's-tag, each node.

[example {% puts [::yaml::load -validate {[aaa, bbb]}]
=>
!!seq {{!!str aaa} {!!str bbb}}
}
]
[list_end]

[call [cmd ::yaml::setOption] [opt [arg options]]]
Change implicit options for the library.
Now, the params are the same as [cmd ::yaml::load].
Arguments of[cmd ::yaml::load] is more priority then this setting.


[call [cmd ::yaml::dict2yaml] [opt [arg indent]] [opt [arg wordwrap]]]
Convert a Tcl dict into YAML striam.

[list_begin definitions]
[def indent]
spaces indent of each block node.
currently default is 2.

[def wordwrap]
word wrap for YAML stream.
currently default is 40.
[list_end]

[call [cmd ::yaml::list2yaml] [opt [arg indent]] [opt [arg wordwrap]]]
Convert a Tcl list into YAML striam.

[list_end]

single item with multiple elements.

[para]

An example of a yaml object converted to Tcl.  A yaml object is returned as a
multi-element list (a dict).

[para]
[example {{
---
- [name        , hr, avg  ]
- [Mark McGwire, 65, 0.278]
- [Sammy Sosa  , 63, 0.288]
- 
  Mark McGwire: {hr: 65, avg: 0.278}
  Sammy Sosa: { hr: 63, avg: 0.288}
}
=>
{name hr avg} {{Mark McGwire} 65 0.278} {{Sammy Sosa} 63 0.288} {{Mark McGwire} {hr 65 avg 0.278} {Sammy Sosa} {hr 63 avg 0.288}}
}]


[section LIMITATIONS]

[para]
tag parser not implemented. currentry, tags are merely ignored.

[para]
Only Anchor => Aliases ordering. back alias-referring is not supported.

[para]
Too strong string converting. mapping key also converted. Don't use strings "null" "true" as keys values.

[para]
Too many blesses, or too few blesses.

[para]
Not enough character set of line feeds. Please use only "\n" as line breaks.

[section {BUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK}]

This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain
