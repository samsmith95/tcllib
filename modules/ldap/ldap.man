[para]

The [package ldap] package provides a simple Tcl-only client library
for the LDAPv3 protocol as specified in

RFC 2251 ([uri http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt]).

It works by opening the standard (or secure) LDAP socket on the
server, and then providing a Tcl API to access the LDAP protocol
commands.  All server errors are returned as Tcl errors (thrown) which
must be caught with the Tcl [cmd catch] command.


[section COMMANDS]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::ldap::connect] [arg host] [opt [arg port]]]

Opens a LDAPv3 connection to the specified [arg host], at the given
[arg port], and returns a token for the connection. This token is the
[arg handle] argument for all other commands. If no [arg port] is
specified it will default to [const 389].

[nl]

The command blocks until the connection has been established, or
establishment definitely failed.


[call [cmd ::ldap::secure_connect] [arg host] [opt [arg port]]]

Like [cmd ::ldap::connect], except that the created connection is
secured by SSL. The port defaults to [const 636].  This command
depends on the availability of the package [package TLS], which is a
SSL binding for Tcl. If [package TLS] is not available, then this
command will fail.

[nl]

The command blocks until the connection has been established, or
establishment definitely failed.


[call [cmd ::ldap::disconnect] [arg handle]]

Closes the ldap connection refered to by the token
[arg handle]. Returns the empty string as its result.


[call [cmd ::ldap::bind] [arg handle] [opt [arg name]] [opt [arg password]]]

This command authenticates the ldap connection refered to by the token
in [arg handle], with a user name and associated password. It blocks
until a response from the ldap server arrives. Its result is the empty
string.

Both [arg name] and [arg passwd] default to the empty string if they
are not specified.


[call [cmd ::ldap::unbind] [arg handle]]

This command asks the ldap server to release the last bind done for
the connection refered to by the token in [arg handle].


[call [cmd ::ldap::search] [arg handle] [arg baseObject] [arg filterString] [arg attributes] [opt "[option -scope] [arg scope]"]]

This command performs a LDAP search below the [arg baseObject] tree
using a complex LDAP search expression [arg filterString] and returns
the specified [arg attributes] of all matching objects (DNs). If the
list of [arg attributes] was empty all attributes are returned. The
command blocks until it has received all results. The default scope used
is subtree, but can be overriden with the [option -scope] option, valid scopes are
[const base], [const subtree] or [const onelevel].

[nl]
An example of a search expression is
[nl]
[example {
    set filterString "|(cn=Linus*)(sn=Torvalds*)"
}]
[nl]

The return value of the command is a list of nested dictionaries. The
first level keys are object identifiers (DNs), second levels keys are
attribute names. In other words, it is in the form

[nl]
[example {
    {dn1 {attr1 val1 attr2 val2 ...}} {dn2 {a1 v1 ...}} ...
}]
[nl]


[call [cmd ::ldap::modify] [arg handle] [arg dn] \
	[arg attrValToReplace] \
	[opt [arg attrToDelete]] \
	[opt [arg attrValToAdd]]]

This command modifies the object [arg dn] on the ldap server we are
connected to via [arg handle]. It replaces attributes with new values,
deletes attributes, and adds new attributes with new values.

All arguments are dictionaries mapping attribute names to values. The
optional arguments default to the empty dictionary, which means that
no attributes will be deleted nor added.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def dictionary attrValToReplace in]

No attributes will be changed if this argument is empty. The
dictionary contains the new attributes and their values. They
[emph {replace all}] attributes known to the object.

[arg_def dictionary attrToDelete in]

No attributes will be deleted if this argument is empty. The
dictionary values are restrictions on the deletion. An attribute
listed here will be deleted if and only if its current value at the
server matches the value specified in the dictionary, or if the value
in the dictionary is the empty string.

[arg_def dictionary attrValToAdd in]

No attributes will be added if this argument is empty. The dictionary
values are the values for the new attributes.

[list_end]
[nl]

The command blocks until all modifications have completed. Its result
is the empty string.


[call [cmd ::ldap::add] [arg handle] [arg dn] [arg attrValueTuples]]

This command creates a new object using the specified [arg dn]. The
attributes of the new object are set to the values in the list
[arg attrValueTuples].
Multiple valuated attributes may be specified using multiple tuples.

The command blocks until the operation has completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::addMulti] [arg handle] [arg dn] [arg attrValueTuples]]

This command is the preferred one to create
a new object using the specified [arg dn]. The
attributes of the new object are set to the values in the dictionary
[arg attrValueTuples] (which is keyed by the attribute names).
Each tuple is a list containing multiple values.

The command blocks until the operation has completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::delete] [arg handle] [arg dn]]

This command removes the object specified by [arg dn], and all its
attributes from the server.

The command blocks until the operation has completed. Its result
is the empty string.


[call [cmd ::ldap::modifyDN] [arg handle] [arg dn] [arg newrdn] [opt [arg deleteOld]]]

This command moves or copies the object specified by [arg dn]
to a new location in the tree of object. This location is
specified by [arg newrdn], a [emph relative] designation.

The optional argument [arg deleteOld] default to to [const true],
i.e. a move operation. If [arg deleteOld] is not set, then the
operation will create a copy of [arg dn] in the new location.

The command blocks until the operation has completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd ip] [arg handle]]

This command returns the IP address of the remote LDAP server the handle is connected to.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd bound] [arg handle]]

This command returns 1 if a handle has successfully completed a [cmd ::ldap::bind], 
if no bound was done or it failed.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd connections] ]

This command returns all currently existing ldap connection handles.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd tls] [arg handle] ]

This command returns 1 if the ldap connection [arg handle] used TLS/SSL for
connection via [cmd ldap::secure_connect], 0 otherwise.

[section EXAMPLES]
[para]

A small example, extracted from the test application coming with this
code.

[para]
[example {
    package require ldap

    # Connect, bind, add a new object, modify it in various ways

    set handle [ldap::connect localhost 9009]

    set dn "cn=Manager, o=University of Michigan, c=US"
    set pw secret

    ldap::bind $handle $dn $pw

    set dn "cn=Test User,ou=People,o=University of Michigan,c=US"

    ldap::add $handle $dn {
	objectClass OpenLDAPperson
	cn          "Test User"
	mail        "test.user@google.com"
	uid         "testuid"
	sn          User
    }

    # Replace all attributes
    ldap::modify $handle $dn [list drink icetea uid JOLO]

    # Add some more
    ldap::modify $handle $dn {} {} [list drink water \
	    drink orangeJuice pager "+1 313 555 7671"]

    # Delete
    ldap::modify $handle $dn {} [list drink water \
	    pager ""]

    # Move
    ldap::modifyDN $handle $dn "cn=Tester"

    # Kill the test object, and shut the connection down.
    set dn "cn=Tester,ou=People,o=University of Michigan,c=US"
    ldap::delete $handle $dn
 
    ldap::unbind     $handle
    ldap::disconnect $handle
}]
[para]

And a another example, a simple query, and processing the
results.

[para]
[example {
    package require ldap
    set handle [ldap::connect ldap.acme.com 389]
    ldap::bind $handle
    set results [ldap::search $handle "o=acme,dc=com" "(uid=jdoe)" {}]
    foreach result $results {
	foreach {object attributes} $result break

	# The processing here is similar to what 'parray' does.
	# I.e. finding the longest attribute name and then
	# generating properly aligned output listing all attributes
	# and their values.

	set width 0
	set sortedAttribs {}
	foreach {type values} $attributes {
	    if {[string length $type] > $width} {
		set width [string length $type] 
	    }
	    lappend sortedAttribs [list $type $values]
	}     

	puts "object='$object'"

	foreach sortedAttrib  $sortedAttribs {
	    foreach {type values} $sortedAttrib break
	    foreach value $values {
		regsub -all "\[\x01-\x1f\]" $value ? value
		puts [format "  %-${width}s %s" $type $value]
	    }
	}
	puts ""
    }
    ldap::unbind $handle
    ldap::disconnect $handle
}]
