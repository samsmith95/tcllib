2005-09-30  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha1.tcl: Refactored to permit implementation selection based
	upon the current interpreter version to try and maximise the speed.

2005-09-30  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* sha1.tcl: Applied [SF Tcllib Patch 1301707] to keep the size of
	  generated numbers within the bounds of 32 bits.

2005-02-24  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha256.tcl: Speeded up the digest calculation.
	* sha1.tcl:   Arranged to run all available implementations in the
	* sha1.test:  tests. Speeded up the calculation.

2005-02-23  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Provide version 1 and version 2
	* sha1.tcl:     Rationalised the handling of accelerator extensions.
	* sha1.test:    Tests fixed for the above.

	* sha1.tcl:    Support cryptkit as a possible accellerator.
	* sha1.test:   Enable testing of cryptkit implementation.

2005-02-22  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha256.tcl:  Inlined a load of expr calls to speed it up.
	
	* sha256.tcl:  SHA-224 and SHA-256 pure-Tcl implementation
	* sha256.test: Tests from FIPS 180-2 for SHA-224 and SHA-256
	This is the first version. It is correct (in that it passes the
	FIPS test vectors) but slow. Speedups to follow.

2005-02-21  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha1.h: replaced the possibly buggy sample extension implementation
	* sha1.c: with shiny new code from the NetBSD project.

	* sha1.test: Added some file tests (16K and 81K)
	* sha1.tcl: Replaced steps 1 and 3 with slightly more efficient
	but equivalent bit operations. Fixed an error with integer length
	exposed with tcl8.5. Verified 8.2-8.5

2005-02-20  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha1c.tcl: Imported the sha1 implementation from the Tcl sample
	* sample.h:  extension and created a critcl wrapper.
	* sample.c:  Added to the sak.tcl critcl generation code.
	
	* sha1.tcl:  Re-implemented to support hashing data in chunks
	* sha1.test: Included tests from RFC 2202 for HMAC-SHA1.
	* sha1.man:  This time we have kept the same API but with optional
	extensions to use files/channels and to request the result as
	binary. Now supports token based hashing as in md4, md5 and ripemd.
	Incremented version to 2.0.0

	* pkgIndex.tcl:
	* sha1.man:
	* sha1.tcl: Fixed bug #614591. Set version of the package to to
	  1.0.3

2003-03-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha1.tcl (sha1::sha1): Applied patch #637770 submitted by Donal
	  Fellows to fix problems on Mac OS X machines. This possibly
	  related to 64/32 bit arithmetic. See changes by Don Porter
	  below.

2003-02-07  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha1.tcl: Check that we have a _working_ C implementation.

2003-02-06  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* sha1.tcl (sha1::time): Use 'lindex' instead of regexp to fetch
	  number from 'time' results.

2002-02-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* sha1.tcl (sha1): Force 32-bit register arithmetic so that
	the right answers are computed even on 64-bit platforms. [446997]

2002-02-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* sha1.tcl (initK,sha1): Force 32-bit interpretation of constants
	larger than INT_MAX on 32-bit processors, due to TIP#72.

2002-02-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* Version up to 1.0.2 to differentiate development from the
	  version in the tcllib 1.2 release.

	* sha1.tcl: Adding -- to hex/sha1 commands to prevent
	  misinterpretation of data if starting with -.

2001-10-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha1.n:
	* sha1.tcl:
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Version up to 1.0.1

2001-08-20  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha1.test: Fixed broken error messages for 8.4. Using
	  [tcltest::getErrorMessage] now to get the correct message for
	  all versions of the core. Bug [440051] reported by Larry Virden.

2001-06-22  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sha1.tcl: Fixed dubious code reported by frink.

2001-06-21  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* New module, 'sha1'. The code is Don Libes's <libes@nist.gov>
	  sha1pure, with Donal K. Fellows's patches to speed it up, and
	  extended with a soft dependency on Trf to allow higher speed if
	  the environment is right.
