#
# Note: The reference defines the matrix in such a way that some of
#       the limitations of the code here are not present. I.e. the
#       definition at wikipedia deals properly with arc directionality
#       and parallelism.
#
# TODO: Rework the code so that the result is in line with the reference.
#       Add features to handle weights as well.

    # Tcl and struct::graph (critcl) may generate different, yet

    # search is done, or nodes have been added to the graph, or ...

    # Fill an array for index tracking later. Note how we start from
