	* rcs.test: First tests.

	* rcs.tcl: New module providing command related to RCS
	  operations. Original sources from Colin McCormack's
	  <coldstore@users.sourceforge.net> Tcl code for acessing CVS
	  repositories, factored out by myself and rewritten for better
	  API modularity. Many thanks to Colin for doing the initial hard
	  work.
