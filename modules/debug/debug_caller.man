[call [cmd debug] [method caller]]

This method is at its core a simple [example {[info level -1]}],
making it useful in a tag-specific prefix to automatically
provide caller information for all uses of the tag. Or in a
message, when only specific places need such detail.

[para] Beyond that it contains code recognizing the various
internal forms of method calls generated by the [package snit]
OO system and rewrites these to their original form, for
better readability.
