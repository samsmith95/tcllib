    test -- Execute testsuites

    sak test run ?-s|--shell PATH? ?-g|--valgrind? ?MODULE ...?

        Run the testsuites of the specified modules, using the shell
        running SAK for the testsuites as well. If no modules are
        specified the testsuites of all modules are run.

        If --valgrind is specified the testsuites are run under
        the valgrind memory checker.

        If one or more --shell's are specified the testsuites are run
        against them. If none are specified the shells registered with
        'shell add' (see below) are used instead. If none are
        specified the shell executing the sak is used instead.

    sak test shells

        Returns a list of the registered shells, one per line, used to
        execute the testsuites.

    sak test shell add PATH...

        Adds the specified paths to the list of shells to use when
        executing testsuites.

    sak test shell delete PATH...

        Removes the specified paths from the list of shells to use
        when executing testsuites.

    NOTE: The list of registered shells is a per-user configuration
	  setting and is saved in the file "$HOME/.Tcllib/Registry".
