Hello.

If you are reading this then you are very likely at the github
__mirror__ of the Tcllib sources.

This means that the
[official location of the sources](https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib)
is somewhere else, just follow the link.

This is also where our issue tracking is done.  We are not tracking
issues at github.  With the exeception of the maintainer of the
mirroring setup nobody will even see issues created at github.

Please use the
[official ticket tracker](https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist)
instead.
