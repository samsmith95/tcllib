[description]
[para]
This package offers both low-level procedures and high-level algorithms
to deal with linear algebra problems:

[list_begin bullet]
[bullet]
robust solution of linear equations or least squares problems
[bullet]
determining eigenvectors and eigenvalues of symmetric matrices
[bullet]
various decompositions of general matrices or matrices of a specific
form
[list_end]

It arose as a re-implementation of Hume's LA package and the desire to
offer low-level procedures as found in the well-known BLAS library.
Matrices are implemented as lists of lists rather linear lists with
reserved elements, as in the original LA package, as it was found that
such an implementation is actually faster.

[para]
It is advisable, however, to use the procedures that are offered, such
as [emph setrow] and [emph getrow], rather than rely on this
representation explicitly: that way it is to switch to a possibly even
faster compiled implementation that supports the same API.


[section "PROCEDURES"]

The package defines the following public procedures (several exist as
specialised procedures, see below):

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::dim] [arg obj]]

Returns the number of dimensions for the object (either 0 for a scalar,
1 for a vector and 2 for a matrix)

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def any obj] Scalar, vector, or matrix
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::shape] [arg obj]]

Returns the number of elements in each dimension for the object (either
an empty list for a scalar, a single number for a vector and a list of
the number of rows and columns for a matrix)

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def any obj] Scalar, vector, or matrix
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::norm] [arg vector] [arg type]]

Returns the norm of the given vector. The type argument can be: 1,
2, inf or max, respectively the sum of absolute values, the ordinary
Euclidean norm or the max norm.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def list vector] Vector, list of coefficients
[arg_def string type] Type of norm (default: 2, the Euclidean norm)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::norm_matrix] [arg matrix] [arg type]]

Returns the norm of the given matrix. The type argument can be: 1,
2, inf or max, respectively the sum of absolute values, the ordinary
Euclidean norm or the max norm.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def list matrix] Matrix, list of row vectors
[arg_def string type] Type of norm (default: 2, the Euclidean norm)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::dotproduct] [arg vect1] [arg vect2]]

Determine the inproduct or dot product of two vectors. These must have
the same shape (number of dimensions)

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def list vect1] First vector, list of coefficients
[arg_def list vect2] Second vector, list of coefficients
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::unitLengthVector] [arg vector]]

Return a vector in the same direction with length 1.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def list vector] Vector to be normalized
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::axpy] [arg scale] [arg mv1] [arg mv2]]

Return a vector or matrix that results from a "daxpy" operation, that
is: compute a*x+y (a a scalar and x and y both vectors or matrices of
the same shape) and return the result.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def double scale] The scale factor for the first vector/matrix (a)
[arg_def list mv1] First vector or matrix (x)
[arg_def list mv2] Second vector or matrix (y)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::add] [arg mv1] [arg mv2]]

Return a vector or matrix that is the sum of the two arguments (x+y)

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def list mv1] First vector or matrix (x)
[arg_def list mv2] Second vector or matrix (y)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::sub] [arg mv1] [arg mv2]]

Return a vector or matrix that is the difference of the two arguments
(x-y)

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def list mv1] First vector or matrix (x)
[arg_def list mv2] Second vector or matrix (y)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::scale] [arg scale] [arg mv]]

Scale a vector or matrix and return the result, that is: compute a*x.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def double scale] The scale factor for the vector/matrix (a)
[arg_def list mv] Vector or matrix (x)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::rotate] [arg c] [arg s] [arg vect1] [arg vect2]]

Apply a planar rotation to two vectors and return the result as a list
of two vectors: c*x-s*y and s*x+c*y. In algorithms you can often easily
determine the cosine and sine of the angle, so it is more efficient to
pass that information directly.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def double c] The cosine of the angle
[arg_def double s] The sine of the angle
[arg_def list vect1] First vector (x)
[arg_def list vect2] Seocnd vector (x)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::transpose] [arg matrix]]

Transpose a matrix

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def list matrix] Matrix to be transposed
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::matmul] [arg mv1] [arg mv2]]

Multiply a vector/matrix with another vector/matrix. The result is
a matrix, if both x and y are matrices or both are vectors, in
which case the "outer product" is computed. If one is a vector and the
other is a matrix, then the result is a vector.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def list mv1] First vector/matrix (x)
[arg_def list mv2] Second vector/matrix (y)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::mkVector] [arg ndim] [arg value]]

Create a vector with ndim elements, each with the value [emph value].

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def integer ndim] Dimension of the vector (number of components)

Create a unit vector in [emph ndim]-dimensional space, along the
[emph ndir]-th direction.

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def integer ndim] Dimension of the vector (number of components)
[arg_def integer ndir] Direction (0, ..., ndim-1)
[list_end]

[nl]
[call [cmd ::math::linearalgebra::mkMatrix] [arg nrows] [arg ncols] [arg value]]

Create a matrix with [emph nrows] rows and [emph ncols] columns. All
elements have the value [emph value].

[list_begin arg]
[arg_def integer nrows] Number of rows
[arg_def integer ncols] Number of columns
[arg_def double value] Uniform value to be used (default: 0.0)
