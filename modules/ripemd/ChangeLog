	* ripemd128.test: Added test cases from RFC2286 to both digests. 
	* ripemd160.test: Also included a test with leading hyphen.
	* ripemd128.tcl:  Removed usage of memchan in favour of the platform
	* ripemd168.tcl:  null device. This avoids problems with name clashes
	                  when loading in [null] or [random].

	* ripemd128.tcl:  Added -- to end options if using Trf's hex in case
	* ripemd160.tcl:  the hash begins with a - character (possible).
	
	* ripemd160.tcl:  Inlined the algorithm functions. This makes the
	pure-Tcl code about 2x faster than the proc calling version.
	* ripemd128.tcl:  Streamlined the <<< implementation a bit.
	
	* ripemd160.man:  Initial implementation of RIPEMD-160 in
	* ripemd160.tcl:  pure-Tcl as per ripemd128.
	* ripemd160.test:
	* pkgIndex.tcl:

	* ripemd128.man:   Initial implementation of RIPEMD-128 in 
	* ripemd128.tcl:   pure-Tcl and deferring to Trf (except on Windows
	* ripemd128.test:  where that has Trf/Memchan bugs).
	* pkgIndex.tcl:
