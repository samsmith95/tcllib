[description]

[para]

The [package comm] command provides an inter-interpreter remote
execution facility much like Tk's [cmd send(n)], except that it uses
sockets rather than the X server for the communication path.  As a
result, [package comm] works with multiple interpreters, works on
Windows and Macintosh systems, and provides control over the remote
execution path.

[para]

These commands work just like [cmd send] and [cmd {winfo interps}] :

[para]
[example {
    ::comm::comm send ?-async? id cmd ?arg arg ...?
    ::comm::comm interps
}]
[para]

This is all that is really needed to know in order to use
[package comm]

[subsection COMMANDS]

The package initializes [cmd ::comm::comm] as the default [emph chan].

[para]
[package comm] names communication endpoints with an [emph id] unique
to each machine.  Before sending commands, the [emph id] of another
interpreter is needed.  Unlike Tk's send, [package comm] doesn't
implicitly know the [emph id]'s of all the interpreters on the system.

The following four methods make up the basic [package comm] interface.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd {::comm::comm send}] [opt -async] \
	[opt "-command [arg callback]"] \
	[arg id] [arg cmd] [opt [arg {arg arg ...}]]]

This invokes the given command in the interpreter named by [arg id].  The
command waits for the result and remote errors are returned unless the
[option -async] or [option -command] option is given.  If [option -async]
is given, send returns immediately and there is no further notification of
result.  If [option -command] is used, [emph callback] specifies a command
to invoke when the result is received.  These options are mutually
exclusive.  The callback will receive arguments in the form
[emph {-option value}], suitable for [cmd {array set}].

The options are: [emph -id], the comm id of the interpreter that received
the command; [emph -serial], a unique serial for each command sent to a
particular comm interpreter; [emph -chan], the comm channel name;
[emph -code], the result code of the command; [emph -errorcode], the
errorcode, if any, of the command; [emph -errorinfo], the errorinfo, if
any, of the command; and [emph -result], the return value of the command.
If connection is lost before a reply is received, the callback will be
invoked with a connection lost message with -code equal to -1.  When
[option -command] is used, the command returns the unique serial for the
command.

[call [cmd {::comm::comm self}]]

Returns the [emph id] for this channel.

[call [cmd {::comm::comm interps}]]

Returns a list of all the remote [emph id]'s to which this channel is
connected.  [package comm] learns a new remote [emph id] when a command
is first issued it, or when a remote [emph id] first issues a command
to this comm channel.  [cmd {::comm::comm ids}] is an alias for this
method.

[call [cmd {::comm::comm connect}] [opt [arg id]]]

Whereas [cmd {::comm::comm send}] will automatically connect to the
given [arg id], this forces a connection to a remote [emph id] without
sending a command.  After this, the remote [emph id] will appear in
[cmd {::comm::comm interps}].

[list_end]

[subsection {EVAL SEMANTICS}]
[para]

The evaluation semantics of [cmd {::comm::comm send}] are intended to
match Tk's [cmd send] [emph exactly]. This means that [package comm]
evaluates arguments on the remote side.

[para]

If you find that [cmd {::comm::comm send}] doesn't work for a
particular command, try the same thing with Tk's send and see if the
result is different.  If there is a problem, please report it.  For
instance, there was had one report that this command produced an
error.  Note that the equivalent [cmd send] command also produces the
same error.

[para]
[example {
    % ::comm::comm send id llength {a b c}
    wrong # args: should be "llength list"
    % send name llength {a b c}
    wrong # args: should be "llength list"
}]
[para]

The [cmd eval] hook (described below) can be used to change from
[cmd send]'s double eval semantics to single eval semantics.

[subsection {MULTIPLE CHANNELS}]
[para]

More than one [cmd comm] channel (or [emph listener]) can be created
in each Tcl interpreter.  This allows flexibility to create full and
restricted channels.  For instance, [term hook] scripts are specific
to the channel they are defined against.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd {::comm::comm new}] [arg chan] [opt [arg {name value ...}]]]

This creates a new channel and Tcl command with the given channel
name.  This new command controls the new channel and takes all the
same arguments as [cmd ::comm::comm].  Any remaining arguments are
passed to the [cmd config] method.  The fully qualified channel
name is returned.

[call [cmd {::comm::comm channels}]]

This lists all the channels allocated in this Tcl interpreter.

[list_end]
[para]

The default configuration parameters for a new channel are:

[para]
[example {
    "-port 0 -local 1 -listen 0 -silent 0"
}]
[para]

The default channel [cmd ::comm::comm] is created with:

[para]
[example {
    "::comm::comm new ::comm::comm -port 0 -local 1 -listen 1 -silent 0"
}]

[subsection {CHANNEL CONFIGURATION}]
[para]

The [cmd config] method acts similar to [cmd fconfigure] in that it
sets or queries configuration variables associated with a channel.

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd {::comm::comm config}]]
[call [cmd {::comm::comm config}] [arg name]]
[call [cmd {::comm::comm config}] [opt "[arg name] [arg value] [arg ...]"]]

When given no arguments, [cmd config] returns a list of all variables
and their value With one argument, [cmd config] returns the value of
just that argument.  With an even number of arguments, the given
variables are set to the given values.

[list_end]

[para]

These configuration variables can be changed (descriptions of them are
elsewhere in this manual page):

[list_begin definitions]
[lst_item "[option -listen] [opt [arg 0|1]]"]
[lst_item "[option -local]  [opt [arg 0|1]]"]
[lst_item "[option -port]   [opt [arg port]]"]
[lst_item "[option -silent] [opt [arg 0|1]]"]

[lst_item "[option -interp] [opt [arg interpreter]]"]
[lst_item "[option -events] [opt [arg eventlist]]"]
[list_end]

[para]
These configuration variables are read only:

[list_begin definitions]
[lst_item "[option -chan]    [arg chan]"]
[lst_item "[option -serial]  [arg n]"]
[lst_item "[option -socket]  sock[arg In]"]
[list_end]

[para]

When [cmd config] changes the parameters of an existing channel (with
the exception of [option -interp] and [option -events]), it closes and
reopens the listening socket.

An automatically assigned channel [emph id] will change when this
happens.

Recycling the socket is done by invoking [cmd {::comm::comm abort}],
which causes all active sends to terminate.


[subsection {ID/PORT ASSIGNMENTS}]
[para]

[package comm] uses a TCP port for endpoint [emph id].  The

[method interps] (or [method ids]) method merely lists all the TCP ports
to which the channel is connected.  By default, each channel's

[emph id] is randomly assigned by the operating system (but usually
starts at a low value around 1024 and increases each time a new socket
is opened).  This behavior is accomplished by giving the

[option -port] config option a value of 0.  Alternately, a specific
TCP port number may be provided for a given channel.  As a special
case, comm contains code to allocate a a high-numbered TCP port
(>10000) by using [option {-port {}}].  Note that a channel won't be
created and initialized unless the specific port can be allocated.

[para]

As a special case, if the channel is configured with

[option {-listen 0}], then it will not create a listening socket and
will use an id of [const 0] for itself.  Such a channel is only good
for outgoing connections (although once a connection is established,
it can carry send traffic in both directions).


As another special case, if the channel is configured with

[option {-silent 0}], then the listening side will ignore connection
attempts where the protocol negotiation phase failed, instead of
throwing an error.

[subsection {EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT}]

A communication channel in its default configuration will use the
current interpreter for the execution of all received scripts, and of
the event scripts associated with the various hooks.

[para]

This insecure setup can be changed by the user via the two options
[option -interp], and [option -events].

[para]

When [option -interp] is set all received scripts are executed in the
slave interpreter specified as the value of the option. This
interpreter is expected to exist before configuration. I.e. it is the
responsibility of the user to create it. However afterward the
communication channel takes ownership of this interpreter, and will
destroy it when the communication channel is destroyed.

Note that reconfiguration of the communication channel to either a
different interpreter or the empty string will release the ownership
[emph without] destroying the previously configured interpreter.  The
empty string has a special meaning, it restores the default behaviour
of executing received scripts in the current interpreter.

[para]

[emph {Also of note}] is that replies and callbacks (a special form of
reply) are [emph not] considered as received scripts. They are
trusted, part of the internal machinery of comm, and therefore always
executed in the current interpreter.

[para]

Even if an interpreter has been configured as the execution
environment for received scripts the event scripts associated with the
various hooks will by default still be executed in the current
interpreter. To change this use the option [option -events] to declare
a list of the events whose scripts should be executed in the declared
interpreter as well. The contents of this option are ignored if the
communication channel is configured to execute received scripts in the
current interpreter.


[subsection {REMOTE INTERPRETERS}]
[para]

By default, each channel is restricted to accepting connections from
the local system.  This can be overridden by using the

[option {-local 0}] configuration option For such channels, the

[emph id] parameter takes the form [emph "\{ id host \}"].

[para]

[emph WARNING]: The [emph host] must always be specified in the same
form (e.g., as either a fully qualified domain name, plain hostname or
an IP address).

[subsection {CLOSING CONNECTIONS}]
[para]

These methods give control over closing connections:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd {::comm::comm shutdown}] [arg id]]

This closes the connection to [arg id], aborting all outstanding
commands in progress.  Note that nothing prevents the connection from
being immediately reopened by another incoming or outgoing command.

[call [cmd {::comm::comm abort}]]

This invokes shutdown on all open connections in this comm channel.

[call [cmd {::comm::comm destroy}]]

This aborts all connections and then destroys the this comm channel
itself, including closing the listening socket.  Special code allows
the default [cmd ::comm::comm] channel to be closed such that the

[cmd ::comm::comm] command it is not destroyed.  Doing so closes the
listening socket, preventing both incoming and outgoing commands on
the channel.  This sequence reinitializes the default channel:

[nl]
[example {
    "::comm::comm destroy; ::comm::comm new ::comm::comm"
}]

[list_end]

[para]

When a remote connection is lost (because the remote exited or called
[cmd shutdown]), [package comm] can invoke an application callback.
This can be used to cleanup or restart an ancillary process, for
instance.  See the [term lost] callback below.

[subsection  CALLBACKS]
[para]
This is a mechanism for setting hooks for particular events:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd {::comm::comm hook}] [arg event] [opt [const +]] [opt [arg script]]]

This uses a syntax similar to Tk's [cmd bind] command.  Prefixing

[arg script] with a [const +] causes the new script to be appended.
Without this, a new [arg script] replaces any existing script.  When
invoked without a script, no change is made.  In all cases, the new
hook script is returned by the command.

[nl]

When an [arg event] occurs, the [arg script] associated with it is
evaluated with the listed variables in scope and available.  The
return code ([emph not] the return value) of the script is commonly
used decide how to further process after the hook.

[nl]
Common variables include:

[list_begin definitions]

[lst_item [var chan]]
the name of the comm channel (and command)

[lst_item [var id]]
the id of the remote in question

[lst_item [var fid]]
the file id for the socket of the connection

[list_end]
[list_end]

[para]
These are the defined [emph events]:

[list_begin definitions]

[lst_item [const connecting]]

Variables:
[var chan], [var id], [var host], and [var port].
[nl]

This hook is invoked before making a connection to the remote named in
[arg id].  An error return (via [cmd error]) will abort the connection
attempt with the error.  Example:

[nl]
[example {
    % ::comm::comm hook connecting {
        if {[string match {*[02468]} $id]} {
            error "Can't connect to even ids" 
        }
    }
    % ::comm::comm send 10000 puts ok
    Connect to remote failed: Can't connect to even ids
    %
}]

[lst_item [const connected]]

Variables:
[var chan], [var fid], [var id], [var host], and [var port].
[nl]

This hook is invoked immediately after making a remote connection to
[arg id], allowing arbitrary authentication over the socket named by
[arg fid].  An error return (via [cmd error] ) will close the
connection with the error.  [arg host] and [arg port] are merely
extracted from the [arg id]; changing any of these will have no effect
on the connection, however.  It is also possible to substitute and
replace [arg fid].

[lst_item [const incoming]]

Variables:
[var chan], [var fid], [var addr], and [var remport].
[nl]

Hook invoked when receiving an incoming connection, allowing arbitrary
authentication over socket named by [arg fid].  An error return (via
[cmd error]) will close the connection with the error.  Note that the
peer is named by [arg remport] and [arg addr] but that the remote
[emph id] is still unknown.  Example:

[nl]
[example {
    ::comm::comm hook incoming {
        if {[string match 127.0.0.1 $addr]} {
            error "I don't talk to myself"
        }
    }
}]


[lst_item [const eval]]

Variables:
[var chan], [var id], [var cmd], and [var buffer].
[nl]

This hook is invoked after collecting a complete script from a remote
but [emph before] evaluating it.  This allows complete control over
the processing of incoming commands.  [arg cmd] contains either
[const send] or [const async].  [arg buffer] holds the script to
evaluate.  At the time the hook is called, [arg {$chan remoteid}] is
identical in value to [arg id].

[nl]

By changing [arg buffer], the hook can change the script to be
evaluated.  The hook can short circuit evaluation and cause a value to
be immediately returned by using [cmd return] [arg result] (or, from
within a procedure, [cmd {return -code return}] [arg result]).  An
error return (via [cmd error]) will return an error result, as is if
the script caused the error.  Any other return will evaluate the
script in [arg buffer] as normal.  For compatibility with 3.2,

[cmd break] and [cmd {return -code break}] [arg result] is supported,
acting similarly to [cmd {return {}}] and [cmd {return -code return}]
[arg result].

[nl]

Examples:

[list_begin enum]

[enum]
augmenting a command
[nl]
[example {
    % ::comm::comm send [::comm::comm self] pid
    5013
    % ::comm::comm hook eval {puts "going to execute $buffer"}
    % ::comm::comm send [::comm::comm self] pid
    going to execute pid
    5013
}]

[enum]
short circuiting a command
[nl]
[example {
    % ::comm::comm hook eval {puts "would have executed $buffer"; return 0}
    % ::comm::comm send [::comm::comm self] pid
    would have executed pid
    0
}]

[enum]
Replacing double eval semantics
[nl]
[example {
    % ::comm::comm send [::comm::comm self] llength {a b c}
    wrong # args: should be "llength list"
    % ::comm::comm hook eval {return [uplevel #0 $buffer]}
    return [uplevel #0 $buffer]
    % ::comm::comm send [::comm::comm self] llength {a b c}
    3
}]

[enum]
Using a slave interpreter
[nl]
[example {
    % interp create foo
    % ::comm::comm hook eval {return [foo eval $buffer]}
    % ::comm::comm send [::comm::comm self] set myvar 123
    123
    % set myvar
    can't read "myvar": no such variable
    % foo eval set myvar
    123
}]

[enum]
Using a slave interpreter (double eval)
[nl]
[example {
    % ::comm::comm hook eval {return [eval foo eval $buffer]}
}]

[enum]
Subverting the script to execute
[nl]
[example {
    % ::comm::comm hook eval {
        switch -- $buffer {
            a {return A-OK}
            b {return B-OK}
            default {error "$buffer is a no-no"}
        }
    }
    % ::comm::comm send [::comm::comm self] pid
    pid is a no-no
    % ::comm::comm send [::comm::comm self] a
    A-OK
}]

[list_end]


[lst_item [const reply]]

Variables:
[var chan], [var id], [var buffer], [var ret], and [var return()].
[nl]

This hook is invoked after collecting a complete reply script from a
remote but [emph before] evaluating it.  This allows complete
control over the processing of replies to sent commands.  The reply
[arg buffer] is in one of the following forms

[list_begin bullet]
[bullet]
return result
[bullet]
return -code code result
[bullet]
return -code code -errorinfo info -errorcode ecode msg
[list_end]
[nl]

For safety reasons, this is decomposed.  The return result is in
[arg ret], and the return switches are in the return array:

[list_begin bullet]
[bullet]
[emph return(-code)]
[bullet]
[emph return(-errorinfo)]
[bullet]
[emph return(-errorcode)]
[list_end]
[nl]

Any of these may be the empty string.  Modifying these four variables
can change the return value, whereas modifying [arg buffer] has no
effect.


[lst_item [const callback]]

Variables:
[var chan], [var id], [var buffer], [var ret], and [var return()].
[nl]

Similar to [emph reply], but used for callbacks.

[lst_item [const lost]]

Variables:
[var chan], [var id], and [var reason].
[nl]

This hook is invoked when the connection to [var id] is lost.  Return
value (or thrown error) is ignored.  [arg reason] is an explanatory
string indicating why the connection was lost.  Example:

[nl]

[example {
    ::comm::comm hook lost {
        global myvar
        if {$myvar(id) == $id} {
            myfunc
            return
        }
    }
}]

[list_end]

[subsection  UNSUPPORTED]
[para]
These interfaces may change or go away in subsequence releases.

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd {::comm::comm remoteid}]]

Returns the [arg id] of the sender of the last remote command
executed on this channel.  If used by a proc being invoked remotely,
it must be called before any events are processed.  Otherwise, another
command may get invoked and change the value.

[call [cmd ::comm::comm_send]]

Invoking this procedure will substitute the Tk [cmd send] and
[cmd {winfo interps}] commands with these equivalents that use
[cmd ::comm::comm].

[nl]

[example {
    proc send {args} {
        eval ::comm::comm send $args
    }
    rename winfo tk_winfo
    proc winfo {cmd args} {
        if {![string match in* $cmd]} {
            return [eval [list tk_winfo $cmd] $args]
        }
        return [::comm::comm interps]
    }
}]

[list_end]

[subsection  SECURITY]
[para]
Something here soon.

[subsection {BLOCKING SEMANTICS}]

[para]

There is one outstanding difference between [package comm] and

[cmd send].  When blocking in a synchronous remote command, [cmd send]
uses an internal C hook (Tk_RestrictEvents) to the event loop to look
ahead for send-related events and only process those without
processing any other events.  In contrast, [package comm] uses the

[cmd vwait] command as a semaphore to indicate the return message has
arrived.  The difference is that a synchronous [cmd send] will block
the application and prevent all events (including window related ones)
from being processed, while a synchronous [cmd {::comm::comm send}]
will block the application but still allow other events to get
processed.  In particular, [cmd {after idle}] handlers will fire
immediately when comm blocks.

[para]

What can be done about this?  First, note that this behavior will come
from any code using [cmd vwait] to block and wait for an event to
occur.  At the cost of multiple channel support, [package comm] could
be changed to do blocking I/O on the socket, giving send-like blocking
semantics.  However, multiple channel support is a very useful feature
of comm that it is deemed too important to lose.  The remaining
approaches involve a new loadable module written in C (which is
somewhat against the philosophy of [cmd comm ]) One way would be to
create a modified version of the [cmd vwait] command that allow the
event flags passed to Tcl_DoOneEvent to be specified.  For [cmd comm],
just the TCL_FILE_EVENTS would be processed.  Another way would be to
implement a mechanism like Tk_RestrictEvents, but apply it to the Tcl
event loop (since [package comm] doesn't require Tk).  One of these
approaches will be available in a future [package comm] release as an
optional component.

[subsection COMPATIBILITY]
[para]

[package comm] exports itself as a package.  The package version number
is in the form [emph "major . minor"], where the major version will
only change when a non-compatible change happens to the API or
protocol.  Minor bug fixes and changes will only affect the minor
version.  To load [package comm] this command is usually used:

[para]
[example {
    package require comm 3
}]

[para]
Note that requiring no version (or a specific version) can also be done.

[para]
The revision history of [package comm] includes these releases:

[list_begin definitions]

[lst_item 4.3]

Bugfixes, and introduces -silent to allow the user to force the
server/listening side to silently ignore connection attempts where the
protocol negotiation failed.

[lst_item 4.2]

Bugfixes, and most important, switched to utf-8 as default encoding
for full i18n without any problems.

[lst_item 4.1]

Rewrite of internal code to remove old pseudo-object model.  Addition
of send -command asynchronous callback option.

[lst_item 4.0]

Per request by John LoVerso. Improved handling of error for async
invoked commands.

[lst_item 3.7]

Moved into tcllib and placed in a proper namespace.

[lst_item 3.6]

A bug in the looking up of the remoteid for a executed command could
be triggered when the connection was closed while several asynchronous
sends were queued to be executed.

[lst_item 3.5]

Internal change to how reply messages from a [cmd send] are handled.
Reply messages are now decoded into the [arg value] to pass to

[cmd return]; a new return statement is then cons'd up to with this
value.  Previously, the return code was passed in from the remote as a
command to evaluate.  Since the wire protocol has not changed, this is
still the case.  Instead, the reply handling code decodes the

[const reply] message.

[lst_item 3.4]

Added more source commentary, as well as documenting config variables
in this man page.  Fixed bug were loss of connection would give error
about a variable named [var pending] rather than the message about
the lost connection.  [cmd {comm ids}] is now an alias for

[cmd {comm interps}] (previously, it an alias for [cmd {comm chans}]).
Since the method invocation change of 3.0, break and other exceptional
conditions were not being returned correctly from [cmd {comm send}].
This has been fixed by removing the extra level of indirection into
the internal procedure [cmd commSend].  Also added propagation of
the [arg errorCode] variable.  This means that these commands return
exactly as they would with [cmd send]:

[nl]
[example {
    comm send id break
    catch {comm send id break}
    comm send id expr 1 / 0
}]
[nl]

Added a new hook for reply messages.  Reworked method invocation to
avoid the use of comm:* procedures; this also cut the invocation time
down by 40%.  Documented [cmd {comm config}] (as this manual page
still listed the defunct [cmd {comm init}]!)


[lst_item 3.3]

Some minor bugs were corrected and the documentation was cleaned up.
Added some examples for hooks.  The return semantics of the [cmd eval]
hook were changed.

[lst_item 3.2]

A new wire protocol, version 3, was added.  This is backwards
compatible with version 2 but adds an exchange of supported protocol
versions to allow protocol negotiation in the future.  Several bugs
with the hook implementation were fixed.  A new section of the man
page on blocking semantics was added.

[lst_item 3.1]

All the documented hooks were implemented.  [cmd commLostHook] was
removed.  A bug in [cmd {comm new}] was fixed.

[lst_item 3.0]

This is a new version of [package comm] with several major changes.
There is a new way of creating the methods available under the

[cmd comm] command.  The [cmd {comm init}] method has been retired
and is replaced by [cmd {comm configure}] which allows access to many
of the well-defined internal variables.  This also generalizes the
options available to [cmd {comm new}].  Finally, there is now a
protocol version exchanged when a connection is established.  This
will allow for future on-wire protocol changes.  Currently, the
protocol version is set to 2.

[lst_item 2.3]

[cmd {comm ids}] was renamed to [cmd {comm channels}].  General
support for [cmd {comm hook}] was fully implemented, but only the
[term lost] hook exists, and it was changed to follow the general
hook API.  [cmd commLostHook] was unsupported (replaced by

[cmd {comm hook lost}]) and [cmd commLost] was removed.

[lst_item 2.2]

The [term died] hook was renamed [term lost], to be accessed by
[cmd commLostHook] and an early implementation of
[cmd {comm lost hook}].  As such, [cmd commDied] is now
[cmd commLost].

[lst_item 2.1]
Unsupported method [cmd {comm remoteid}] was added.

[lst_item 2.0]
[package comm] has been rewritten from scratch (but is fully compatible
with Comm 1.0, without the requirement to use obTcl).

used for free, without any licensing fee or royalty.


[section BUGS]
[list_begin bullet]
[bullet]

If there is a failure initializing a channel created with
[cmd {::comm::comm new}], then the channel should be destroyed.
Currently, it is left in an inconsistent state.

[bullet]

There should be a way to force a channel to quiesce when changing the
configuration.

[list_end]

[para]
The following items can be implemented with the existing hooks and are
listed here as a reminder to provide a sample hook in a future
version.

[list_begin bullet]
[bullet]

Allow easier use of a slave interp for actual command execution
(especially when operating in "not local" mode).

[bullet]

Add host list (xhost-like) or "magic cookie" (xauth-like)
authentication to initial handshake.

[list_end]

[para]
The following are outstanding todo items.

[list_begin bullet]
[bullet]

Add an interp discovery and name->port mapping.  This is likely to be
in a separate, optional nameserver.  (See also the related work,
below.)

[bullet]

Fix the [emph {{id host}}] form so as not to be dependent upon
canonical hostnames.  This requires fixes to Tcl to resolve hostnames!

[section {ON USING OLD VERSIONS OF TCL}]

[para]
Tcl7.5 under Windows contains a bug that causes the interpreter to
hang when EOF is reached on non-blocking sockets.  This can be
triggered with a command such as this:

[para]
[example {
    "comm send $other exit"
}]

[para]
Always make sure the channel is quiescent before closing/exiting or
use at least Tcl7.6 under Windows.

[para]
Tcl7.6 on the Mac contains several bugs.  It is recommended you use
at least Tcl7.6p2.

[para]
Tcl8.0 on UNIX contains a socket bug that can crash Tcl.  It is recommended
you use Tcl8.0p1 (or Tcl7.6p2).


[section {RELATED WORK}]
[para]
Tcl-DP provides an RPC-based remote execution interface, but is a
compiled Tcl extension.  See
[uri http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/zeno/Projects/Tcl-DP.html].

[para]
Michael Doyle <miked@eolas.com> has code that implements the Tcl-DP
RPC interface using standard Tcl sockets, much like [package comm].

[para]
Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> uses
[package comm] and has built a simple nameserver as part of his Pool
library.  See [uri http://www.purl.org/net/akupries/soft/pool/index.htm].
