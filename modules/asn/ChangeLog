	* New module: ASN.1 de- and encoding. This was provided to us
	  indirectly by Joechen Loewer <loewerj@web.de>, through the ldap
	  module. It contains the same functionality internally.

	* Added doctools documentation. Referenced the "Layman's Guide to
	  a Subset of ASN.1, BER, and DER" and added text version to the
	  sources, to guide future work.
