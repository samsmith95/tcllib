[description]
[para]

The package described by this document, [package struct::graph::op],
is a companion to the package [package struct::graph]. It provides a
series of common operations and algorithms applicable to (un)directed
graphs.

[para]

Despite being a companion the package is not directly dependent on
[package struct::graph], only on the API defined by that
package. I.e. the operations of this package can be applied to any and
all graph objects which provide the same API as the objects created
through [package struct::graph].

[section {Operations}]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd struct::graph:op::toAdjacencyMatrix] [arg g]]

This command takes the graph [arg g] and returns a nested list
containing the adjacency matrix of [arg g].

[para]

The elements of the outer list are the rows of the matrix, the inner
elements are the column values in each row. The matrix has "[var n]+1"
rows and columns, with the first row and column (index 0) containing
the name of the node the row/column is for. All other elements are
boolean values, [const True] if there is an arc between the 2 nodes
of the respective row and column, and [const False] otherwise.

[para]

Note that the matrix is symmetric. It does not represent the
directionality of arcs, only their presence between nodes. It is also
unable to represent parallel arcs in [arg g].
