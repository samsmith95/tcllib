	* ChangeLog, calendar.tcl, gregorian.tcl, gregorian.test:
	* pkgIndex.tcl, tclIndex:
	Created an initial 'calendar' module.  Functionality at this
	point includes conversion between Julian Day and several formats:
	year/day-of-year, year/month/day, year/week/day-of-week, and
	year/month/day-of-week-in-month (e.g, the second Friday of
	February).
