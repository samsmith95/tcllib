	* multiplexer.tcl (NewClient): Added access denied debug message
	for accessfilter.

	* multiplexer.man: Minor cleanups.

	* multiplexer.test: Added several tests.

	* multiplexer.tcl: Adding updated multiplexer to tcllib.  It is
	now possible to run multiple multiplexer instances, and it uses
	the logger package for logging.

	* multiplexer.man: New file, still needs cleaning up.  Content
	taken from old multiplexer.n.

	* multiplexer.test: Added a few initial tests.  Working on more.
