	* rc4.test: Fixed x-version problems of the testsuite. The tests
	  wrongly used the tcltest::wrongNumArgs command. In this case the
	  error message is generated by the proc code and the same across
	  all versions of Tcl.

	* rc4.test: Added basic command tests.
	* rc4c.tcl: Critcl implementation.
	* rc4.tcl:  Support critcl implementation.

	* rc4.tcl:  Storing the state as a list and using lset is faster
	than using an array provided we have a built-in lset
	command. Added both versions and switch appropriately to get the
	fastest implementation for the tcl version. Tested 8.2 - 8.5.

	* rc4.tcl:  Pure tcl implementation of the Alledged RC4 stream cipher.
	* rc4.test: Some published test vectors for RC4.
	* rc4.man:  Documentation.
