	* snit.test: Fixed SF tcllib bug #772535. Instead of using a
	* snit.tcl:  variable reference in the callback a regular command
	             is called, with the unchanging 'selfns' as argument.
		     From there things go through the regular dispatching
		     mechanism after the actual instance name was obtained.
		     Updated all affected tests.

		     Updated dmethod-1.5 also, 'string' delivers a
		     different error message.

	* snit.man:    Added references to bug trackers, as part of
	* snitfaq.man: caveats. Also added note about bwidget/snit
	               interaction.

	* snit.tcl: Integrated latest (small) change to original code base
	  (was not released yet). Removes bad trial to fix up error stack.
	  We are now at version 0.82. Added note to developers explaining
	  the catch in Snit_tracer.
