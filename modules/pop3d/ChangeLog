	* pop3d.man: More semantic markup, less visual one.
	* pop3d_dbox.man:
	* pop3d_udb.man:

	* pop3d.tcl (Transfer): Use a single dot to write the
	  terminator. Not \n.\n. Puts does the terminating \n, and
	  buildmessage/copymessage the other. Brought the client out of
	  sync after a retrieval because of an empty line after the
	  terminator line of the multi-line response.

	* Note aside: The pop3 server may understate the size of a message
	  and of the maildrop. This happens as the package 'mime' we use
	  to transfer a message may add additional headers not present in
	  the original message (For example Mime-Version and/or
	  Content-Type).

	* pop3d.tcl (::pop3d::Transfer): Fixed oversight in my usage of
	  'mime::copymessage'. This command copies a mime message to a
	  channel, but does not know about the framing protocol. In other
	  words, it does not write the singular dot closing a pop3 data
	  transfer. We have to do this in the calling routine. Added such
	  a piece of code. Fixed problem with distinguishing RETR and TOP
	  modes, wrong conditional.

	* pop3d.test: 
	* pop3d.tcl (CheckLogin): Now additionally retrieves size of
	  maildrop after querying the number of waiting messages.
	  (H_stat): Returns size of maildrop as second result of
	  STAT. Bugfix, pop3d was not rfc 1939 compliant with respect to
	  STAT, and now is. This problem was found while working on the
	  testsuite for the pop3 package (Result of pop3::stat was
	  bogus). Updated the testsuite.

	* pop3d_dbox.tcl: 
	* pop3d_dbox.man: method 'size' no accepts a call without message
	  id and returns the total size of the mail drop for that
	  case. Reason for the change: see above.

	* pop3d.test: Modified testsuite courtesy Gerald Lester
	  <gwlester@users.sourceforge.net> for better execution of the
	  subshells under windows.

	* pop3d.test:
	* pop3d.man:
	* pop3d_dbox.tcl: Split port into configured port and true
	  port. This allows the usage of port "0" to force auto-selection
	  of a free port. Documented the special behaviour of
	  -port. Created testsuite for pop3 server. Tcllib #532216.

2002-05-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop3d_dbox.man:
	* pop3d_dbox.tcl:
	* pop3d_dbox.test: New method [destroy]. Extended
	  documentation. Clarified interaction lock/remove and interaction
	  lock/stat/(size/get/dele). Added checks of message ids in size,
	  get, dele. Added general check of define base directory to all
	  methods. Added testsuite. Bugfixes. Tcllib #532216.

	* pop3d_udb.man:
	* pop3d_udb.tcl: 
	* pop3d_udb.test: Documented [destroy]. Fixed documentation of
	  [lookup], refered to non-existing method [do]. Added [destroy]
	  method. Added test suite. Tcllib #532216.

2002-03-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* New module. Pop3 server, and associated objects for simple user
	  and mailbox management. No testsuite yet. Testsuite will be
	  written in conjunction with testsuite for pop3 module.
