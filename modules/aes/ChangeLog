	* aes.tcl:      Re-written to support CBC mode AES and to allow for
	* aes.test:     the tcllib-style programming API (as per blowfish, RC4 and
	* aes.man:      the hash implementations). Converted from an array based
	* pkgIndex.tcl: implementation to a list based implementation and
	                gained a 4x speedup. Set to 1.0.0 for now the API is fixed.
