2006-09-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added commands constructing wrong#args
	  messages for snit methods, depending on snit version.

2006-09-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Ensure that the makeFile/Dir wrapper are
	  created only once. Also modified the code to modify the
	  originals to return the full name. The wrapper are needed only
	  as indicators.

2006-04-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added set of commands for the easy assembly
	  of complex results. Mainly a shorthand for 'lappend', using a
	  common variable.

2006-01-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Force re-import of tcltest commands after
	  changes made by the support system. Added code forcing a useful
	  result value of makeFile/makeDirectory even for Tcltest 1.x
	  (path created instead of list of all paths). Command for the
	  creation of a binary temp. file, and a command to return the
	  path of temp files without us having to create them.

	* coserv.tcl: Fixed usage of temp. files by comm server.

	* coserv.tcl: Fixed output for a better fit with the other test
	* dialog.tcl: support.

2006-01-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added variants of the use commands which keep
	  the relevant namespace. Sometimes necessary to prevent
	  destruction of support code loaded first.

2006-01-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added commands for the loading of files and
	  packages from the Tcllib under test. This will reduce the amount
	  of boilerplate in a .test file spent on getting the package
	  under test, its supporting packages, and other helper files.

	  Added helpers for dealing with loading "tcllibc" package and
	  packages using it.

2006-01-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Moved the definitions of the common
	  constraints out of the toplevel "all.tcl" into the test support
	  code.

2006-01-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: New file for boilerplate code and common
	  commands used by most to all testsuites in Tcllib.

2005-10-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.8 ========================
	* 

2004-10-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dialog.tcl: More log output for better tracing of the
	  internals. Especially added trace when receiving an incomplete
	  line while waiting for data from the peer. Added code to clean
	  up old connections, prevent leakage of channel handles.

2004-10-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* muserv.tcl:  Removed the old facilities for sub processes
	* musub.tcl:   and programmed interactions. They have been
	* subserv.tcl: superceded by the code below.

	* coserv.tcl: New sub process mgmt based on "comm".
	* dialog.tcl: New code for programmed dialogs based on
	  "coserv.tcl".

2004-10-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.7 ========================

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	* 

2003-05-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* subserv.tcl (muserv): Propagate the auto_path into the
	  subprocess so that it is able to find all packages the server
	  might require. Without that the server will need an installed
	  tcllib, for example. This fixes a hang in the pop3 testsuite
	  when tcllib is not installed.

2003-04-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* New module. 
	* First contents are support for sub-processes in testsuites.
