    readme -- Generate a readme listing changes to modules and packages.

    sak readme ?review?

    	This command compares the current state of the modules and
    	packages and against information from the last release
    	(support/releases/PACKAGES) and generates a README.txt listing
    	the relevant changes (new modules/packages, package version
    	changes, unchanged packages).

	The generated README is written to stdout.

	If a 'review' argument is given it will be treated as a path
	and the specified file is written too as well. This file will
	contain a simple script afterwards, which, when run, guides
	the user through the review of the changelogs and packages the
	command here found itself in trouble with.

	This is a support command for the release manager.
