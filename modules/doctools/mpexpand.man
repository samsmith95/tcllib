This manpage describes the processor / converter for manpages in the
format described in the manpage [strong mp_rules].

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd mpexpand] [opt "-module [arg module]"] [arg format] [arg infile]|- [arg outfile]|-]

The processor takes three arguments, namely the code describing which
formatting to generate as the output, the file to read the markup
from, and the file to write the generated output into. If the
[arg infile] is "[strong -]" the processor will read from
[strong stdin]. If [arg outfile] is "[strong -]" the processor will
write to [strong stdout].

[nl]

If the option [arg -module] is present its value overrides the internal
definition of the module name.

The currently known output formats are

[list_begin definitions]

[lst_item [strong nroff]]

The processor generates *roff output, the standard format for unix
manpages.

[lst_item [strong html]]

The processor generates HTML output, for usage in and display by web
browsers.

[lst_item [strong tmml]]

The processor generates TMML output, the Tcl Manpage Markup Language,
a derivative of XML.

[lst_item [strong latex]]

The processor generates LaTeX output.

[list_end]

[call [cmd mpexpand.all] [opt [arg -verbose]] [opt [arg module]]]

This command uses [strong mpexpand] to generate all possible output
formats for all manpages in the current directory. The manpages are
recognized through the extension [strong .man]. If [arg -verbose] is
specified the command will list its actions before executing them.

[nl]

The [arg module] information is passed to [cmd mpexpand].
