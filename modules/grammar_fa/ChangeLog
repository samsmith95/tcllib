	* All files: Bugfixes in basic FA support. Updated tests, updated
	  documentation. Completed implementation of more comlex FA
	  operations, their documentation, and their tests. Test suite is
	  now definitely in overkill, taking 13 minutes to run :P

	* tests/fa_state.test
	* tests/fa_is_complete.test
	* tests/fa_is_cons.test
	* fa.tcl: Fixed definition of 'is complete' for FAs without
	  symbols. Updated tests. Fixed deletion of states, added test for
	  the fixed case. Aded construction from serialization. Updated
	  tests. Added cache for epsilon closures.

	* fa.man: Removed the remnants of the documentation for 'state
	  priority'. Added the missing documentation for all 'is' commands
	  beyond 'deterministic'.
