	* 

2005-10-03  Andreas Kupries <andreask@gila.activestate.com>

	* me_tcl.test (ME_state): token ranks are stored in an array/dict,
	  used dictsort to generate a canonical representation we can
	  compare against. ... Also duplicate tokclass test depending on
	  error message by "string is", different results in 8.4 and 8.5.
