Welcome to the tcllib, the Tcl Standard Library.  This package is
intended to be a collection of Tcl packages that provide utility
functions useful to a large collection of Tcl programmers.

The home web site for this code is http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/ .
At this web site, you will find mailing lists, web forums, databases
for bug reports and feature requests, the CVS repository (browsable on
the web, or read-only accessible via CVS ), and more.

The structure of the tcllib source hierarchy is:

tcllib
 +- modules
     +- <module1>
     +- <module2>
     +- ...


The install hierarchy is:

.../lib/tcllib
        +- <module1>
        +- <module2>
        +- ...

There are some base requirements that a module must meet before it
will be added to tcllib:

* the module must be a proper Tcl package
* the module must use a namespace for its commands and variables
* the name of the package must be the same as the name of the
  namespace
* the module must reside in a subdirectory of the modules directory in
  the source hierarchy, and that subdirectory must have the same name
  as the package and namespace
* the module must be released under the BSD License, the terms of
  which can be found in the toplevel tcllib source directory in the file
  license.terms
* the module should have both documentation (in XML, man, or HTML
  form) and a test suite (in the form of a group of *.test files in
  the module directory).
* the module must have either documentation or a test suite.  It can
  not have neither.
* the module should adhere to Tcl coding standards

When adding a module to tcllib, be sure to add it to the Makefile.in
so it will be installed.  Add a line like:

MYNEWMODULE=mynewmodule

to the list of modules at the top of the Makefile.in, and then add
$(MYNEWMODULE) to the definition of the MODULES variable.  This will
allow users to choose which modules to install by commenting or
uncommenting lines in the Makefile.

Each module source directory should have no subdirectories (other than
the CVS directory), and should contain the following files:

* source code		*.tcl
* package index		pkgIndex.tcl
* tests			*.test
* documentation		*.n, *.xml

If you do not follow this directory structure, the tcllib Makefile
will fail to locate the files from the new module.
